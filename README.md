# Learning C: A Journey to Low-Level Programming

Welcome to my learning repo! Here's the start of my learning journey as I dive into the C programming language. My goal is to gain a deep understanding of low-level programming concepts and learn how computers work at a fundamental level. I hope to look back at this one day from closer to the top of the mountain and smile.

> Some of the source code and ideas in this repository are inspired by and adapted from the excellent [Bro Code YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez). Big shoutout for making C more approachable and fun to learn!

## Objectives

- **Master the Basics of C**: Build a solid foundation in C programming, from syntax and data structures to memory management and pointers.
- **Understand Low-Level Concepts**: Explore how C operates closely with the hardware, allowing me to learn about memory, CPU architecture, and the inner workings of computers.
- **Reverse Engineering Skills**: Ultimately, I aim to apply this knowledge toward reverse engineering binaries, breaking down and understanding compiled code.

## Progress

- **Hello World**: Because you just have to, right?
- **Basic Calculator**: Basic addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. Nothing special here.

## Pain Points

- **Compiling**: Seems like installing a reliable compiler in Windows is easier said than done. In Linux you just kinda gcc it all.
